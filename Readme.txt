Initial Steps:
 
conda create -n <envirenment name> python=3.8
conda activate <envirenment name>
pip install -r requirements.txt


Running:

Python file : A2.py
-full_sweep(in the __main__ function) is set to False by default, this will generate a new run file based on pre-trained model predictions
-Setting full_sweep=True, would start hyperparameter tuning,then K-fold cross validation and then make a new run file
	based on a newly tuned model

Files and Descriptions:


A2 OLD.tsv : best test run out of the three sent for scoring (NDCG 0.6215)
A2.tsv- Run generated by the exact same model on Linux OS.
Final_Tuned_Model.json : Pre-trained model which will be picked up to predict and generate a new 
			tsv if full_sweep=False
test.tsv : given test dataset	
	
train.tsv : given train dataset

requirements.txt : libraries required for reproducibility
